0.1

= 1. User Requirements =

|| _ID_ || _Description_ ||
||  UR 1  *Access* || Only admins can run the tool   ||

= 2. Functional Requirements =

Section 2 organizes functional requirements into the following sections.
  * Glossary
  * 2.1 Input
  * 2.2 Logic
  * 2.3 UI, Reporting,  and Logs

_Numbering convention: to reduce "dot" separators document hides the first section number. Prefixes help distinguish sections. So 2.1.3.1  becomes "FR 1.3.1" instead._

== Glossary ==

|| _Term_ || _Definition or Details_ ||
|| *CME* || Content Manager Explorer ||
|| *FR *|| Functional Requirement ||
|| *Reference Component* || A user-selected/created Component  with default field values ||
|| *Synchronization* || Process of confirming, updating, and/or removing (validating) each target component field against its (updated) schema. Non-synchronized components are "out-of-sync." ||
|| *Target Component(s)* || Content the tool will update. Assumes all matching components in a given publication; however, a more sophisticated tool may allow user ability to search or select smaller set of target components. ||
|| *"Tool"*  || Term for Component Synchronizer, at least in the requirements below. Similar to "system" (e.g. system will...). ||
|| *User* || Requirements refer to "User" to avoid confusion with "Content Author." CMS administrator use only. ||

== 2.1. Input ==
|| _ID_ || _Description_ ||
|| FR 1.1  *Publication*  || Tool needs publication context (can be implied by item selection) ||
|| FR 1.2  *Schema* || User selects schema and runs Tool  via context menu in CME. Advanced options include via component context menu, single component, or component search. ||   
|| FR 1.3 *Default Schema Fields* || User sets default overriding fields. Tool will use a "reference" component. || 
|| FR 1.3.1 *Override Fields * || User checks which default values override component fields. _Alternative is to assume no override--only use reference component default field values for empty fields._ ||
|| FR 1.4 *Run-time Requirement* || Fields and schema structure are unknown until tool runs. "Standard" Content XML assumed (namespaces, `<content>`, etc).* || 

_*Developer(s) should investigate any schema differences between R5.3/2009 and 2011_

== 2.2. Logic ==

|| _ID_ || _Description_ ||
|| FR 2.1 *Single Publication Context*  || Tool will synchronize components in a single publication, using the shared schema definition and reference component in the same context. Tool will ignore parent and child items in other publications. ||
|| FR 2.2 *Stop for Workflow Association* || Tool will warn user and stop if selected schema has an associated workflow definition. User removes association manually. ||
|| FR 2.3 *Validate Reference Component* || Tool must synchronize or at least warn user and stop process if reference component is out-of-sync. Reference component's schema must match selected schema (likely implicit--only show appropriate components). ||
|| FR 2.4 *Preserve Defaults* || Tool will set default field values for its fields in target components based on selected schema. Existing values will not be overwritten unless the overwrite (or override) checkbox is checked.||
|| FR 2.5 *Remove Old Fields* || Tool will remove invalid nodes and content, mimicking CME update/save/close behavior. Use rollback and history to see old fields. ||
|| FR 2.6 *Re-order Matched Fields* || If possible, tool will match and fix out-of-order sibling nodes (within same nesting level). For example, tool will fix a "header" field moved up or down in a schema. Tool will ignore "header" fields from different embeddable schema or that are descendents of each other. ||
|| FR 2.7 *Recover from Single Failure* || Upon individual synchronization failure, tool should do partial update and log failures. ||
|| FR 2.8 *Ignore Checked-out Target Components* ||  Tool should log but not update checked-out components. ||
|| FR 2.9 *Warn on Multiple-to-Single Field Changes* || Tool should warn user for multiple-to-single selection changes (e.g. selection box or check box to drop-down or radio button). At the minimum, report which components will be or were affected. ||
|| FR 2.10 *Match CME Behavior* || When in doubt, tool should match CME behavior when user opens, updates, and saves (& closes) a component. ||
|| FR 2.10.1 *Run XSLT Filter* || Tool should run rich text against the schema XSLT filter if possible, mimicking the CME.  ||
|| FR 2.10.2 *No Changes* || Tool should ignore changes to allowed formatting / allowed style. ||

== 2.3. UI, Reporting,  and Logs ==

|| _ID_ || _Description_ ||
|| FR 3.1 *Report Successes* || Tool should display (aggregated) progress and successful updates (e.g. 90 out of 100 components successfully updated). ||
|| FR 3.2 *Log Individual Failures* || Tool must capture tcm id and problem field(s)  or error for individual failures.  ||
|| FR 3.3 *Log Checked-out Items * || Tool must report tcm id for checked-out items either before or after synchronization. ||
|| FR 3.4 *Log Data Loss* || Tool should remind users which components to revisit due to multiple-to-single field selection data loss (per FR 2.9). ||
|| FR 3.5 *Prominent Warning* || Text TBD. Tool should warn user about data loss and recommend precautions such as content porting, running only on dev, etc.  ||

= 3. Other Considerations =
 * Richtext-to-plain text?
 * Min/Max and schema attributes?

= 4. Technical Requirements =

== 4.1 High-level approach ==

 * Component Synchronizer will use PowerTools (MVC) framework
  * Client-side code make calls to Component Synchronizer  service
  * Service
    * Uses Core Service API for pre-synchronization validations and business logic 
    * Uses XSLT for bulk of transformation, recursively evaluating schema field definitions against target component fields
    * Returns updates to client asynchronously
 * Issues saved to CM log files or presented to user in save-able format

<wiki:comment>
Add a fake QueryString paramater above to make the generated image show (e.g. &faked=fake.png).

Update the diagram on [http://www.websequencediagrams.com/?lz=UGFnZS9Vc2VyIC0-IEphdmFTY3JpcHQ6cmVxdWVzdAoACQogLT4gV2ViIFNlcnZpY2U6KHNlcmlhbGl6ZWQpIG9iamVjdAphY3RpdmF0ZQAdDAoAKgsANBAgQ29yZS9DTUUACB10cmFuc2Zvcm0gY29tcG9uZW50cwBGEACBMAsAgQUUZGUAgQYVAIFQDkRvbTogbWFuaXB1bGF0ZXMKRG9tIC0-IACCGwk6IHNob3cgcmVzdWx0cyBhbmQgbG9n&s=default WebSequenceDiagrams] (will need to update these links)

== 4.3 Existing Code ==
_Please review [http://www.sdltridionworld.com/community/extension_overview/powertools.aspx previous PowerTools] code for sample XSLT code and validations. Update this wiki page with issues and additional requirements._

= 5. UI  =

Peter Kjaer merged Jaime's changes into \trunk. This branch addresses the following.

 * RTF fields rely on the Ribbon Tool bar (it's where the RTF tools are shown) and the tool would have to implement it. 
 * Existing extensions won't be available in the tool, unless they would be implemented.
 * Re-use existing the Component View that copies with all the requirements for Content Creation

Approach uses the Component View for content creation, meaning that when I want to synchronize content based on a given schema, the Power User will have to create a "reference" component, i.e. a Component based on the schema we want to synchronize providing with the reference data, stuff like default values for missing fields, for example.

The user can create a Reference component without using the tool and then browse it from the tool as well. The tool will provide with an option to launch the New Component (reference) creation, though.

=== 5.1 Features ===

These UI features are programmed, but only on the UI side. Program the service code next.

First priority:
  * Launch the Component Synchronizer from a Schema

Available, but program in a future release:
  * Launch the Component Synchronizer from a Component (context TBD: either reference component or "to-be-synched" component.)
  * Launch the Component Synchronizer from a Selection (within a list)
  * Launch the Component Synchronizer from a Search, by selecting the results 

=== 5.2 Screenshots ===

Launch from schema (first priority):

Launch from search results (optional):
