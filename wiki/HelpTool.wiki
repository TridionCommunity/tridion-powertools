#summary PowerTool Requirements for End-User Help Screen
#labels Phase-Requirements

= Introduction =

A "Help" option to provide end-user "how-to" information, instructions, and ways to contact the PowerTools group. 

This will be a simple tool as a collection of information, though a more sophisticated help system could offer context-sensitive options or integration directly into individual tools (via a help button for each tool, hover-over text, etc).

= Details =

||Suggested implementation||Original Developer||Priority||Difficulty||Status||Notes||
||Button on PowerTools dashboard tab||N/A / new suggestion by Alvin Reyes||Medium||Low||In requirements||Good learning experience, but should aim to actually be helpful to end users. Could eventaully incorporate, include, or explain the "example" PowerTool (which can eventually be hidden from regular users) ||

==Description==
Help screen will provide three types of information to the end user:
 # Basic "how-to" information for the released PowerTools
 # Contact info and bug submission instructions
 # Developer information (optional, since devs can visit the code repository)

==Scope==
*In-scope:*
 * Information to help end users (including power users and developers acting as end users, interacting with the CME)
 * PowerTools logo, credits, contact information, images, video, and other rich text or multimedia to explain the tools 
 * end-user troubleshooting information
 * Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*Out-of-scope:*
 * instructions on how to develop PowerTools, though a reference to the project or information on the example PowerTool would be appropriate
 * sand-box or playground examples (local, non-committed code and the ExamplePowerTool should be used for this)

== Audience ==
All users

*Version #*
0.0

Original release date

TBD

*Last updated:*

Initial requirements 08-Dec-2011

== Installation ==
See InstallationGuide, this tool will be installed with the rest of the PowerTools.

=== Upgrade ===

Updates will be available through PowerTools upgrade mechanism (currently via source control update and source code compile).

= Functional Requirements =
|| ID || Description || Comments ||
|| 1 || *Helpful.* Help screen must describe basic PowerTools instructions, including how to use a "generic" tool. || All users, tool must be available from the PowerTools tab ||
|| 2 || *Comprehensive.* Help screen should list available tools and their descriptions || Screenshots helpful, but optional. ||
|| 3 || *Integrated.* User should be able to return to the CME or other PowerTools easily || Help should be incorporated along with the PowerTools (rather than an install, help file system, or PDF)  ||
|| 4 || *Easy-to-understand.* Language and content style must target end users, avoid jargon, but use SDL Tridion terminology as appropriate  || (not an easy task for sure, but "component" and "build blocks" are preferred over generic terms)  ||
|| 5 || *Maintainable.* Documentation and content must be easily maintained by a user familiar with HTML.  || HTML, XML, or configuration-type setup would be ok. Avoid hard-coding content in classes or source code. ||
|| 6 || *Easy-to-update.* The implementation must be set up to make it clear where to add PowerTools information || A help system isn't helpful if it makes it hard for developers to add the help info! ||
|| 7 || *Consistent.* The order of the help must match the order of the PowerTools buttons. PowerTools that don't have a button in the dashboard should be listed first. || Ideally the order should be easily maintained. ||
|| 8 || *Connected.* Must include "easy" ways for end users to submit PowerTools feedback such as bug submission, free-form feedback, or questions on the tool || This doesn't have to be fancy, but can include links to the Flow Dock, social media buttons, an email address, the code repository site (Google Code), and/or a link to the discussion group.  ||
|| 9 || Seamless. If/when the PowerTools include an installer, consider incorporating this help information along-side or into the CME help system.  || Possible? Desirable? Consider low-priority until ComponentSynchronizer and PagePublisher are at least done (revisit 2012 Q2). ||
